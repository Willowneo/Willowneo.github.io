            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My introduction into the art world started really rough. I graduated high school in 2018 and had just been accepted into my top art college to major in photography.
                In the fall of 2018, I made my first major change and moved out of my childhood home, into an unknown town house owned by the college with 6 girls who I barely knew.
                I know this sounds fairly normal for a college student, but I was freshly 18, had severe and untreated depression and anxiety, and never lived away from my family before. 
                I missed all of orienation week due to my anxiety and depression and almost left the school before classes even started. I did make the decision to stay, but things 
                didn't really get better. Throughout my freshman year, I struggled to stay afloat as a fresh art student while struggling with my mental health. I did push through and 
                finished the year, but part of me didn't want to go back. Sophmore year started and a repeat of last year happened. Luckily I had gained resources to help me through, but 
                the rest of the semester, for lack of a better term, ruined me. I won't go into detail, but I made the very difficult decision to drop out. After a few months of therapy, I 
                was diagnosed with PTSD. This was at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. That time felt like a blur but I have grown and conquered so much since then. Now I am back in school,
                finishing my associates in graphic design, and I cannot wait to accomplish more throughout my life.
